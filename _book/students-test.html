<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Normalization</h2>
<p>Normalization allows to resolve the bias and errors introduced between the samples by the experimental tools or the samples preparation. Normalization relies on the fact that most of the proteins are expected to be expressed the same way between the samples, so it is necessary to remove the differences induced by the experiment to not overestimate the differencial expression. here we use the mean center and scaling normalization : centering assure that the mean of the different samples is equal (set to 0), and scaling sets the standard deviation to 1.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3</span> Differentially expressed proteins</h3>
<p>A protein is considered differentially expressed if its p.value and fold change are superior to a determined threshold. The fold change represent how much a protein is differentially expressed between two conditions and the p value allows to evaluate the statistical significance of this difference.</p>
