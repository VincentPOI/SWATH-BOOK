#Introduction

SWATH-MS is a data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry techinique that allows to identify and quantify a great number of protein in a single sample. This technique is therefore suitable for proteomics studies trying to assess the variation in the protein expression of different samples, in order to determine the proteins affected by a certain factor.

The data in this example comes from : Bjelosevic S, Pascovici D, Ping H, et.al. Quantitative age-specific variability of plasma proteins in healthy neonates, children and adults. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics (March 23 2017).
The studies try to understand the impact of the life stage on protein expression. Four age group are compared each age group comport ten replicates :  
-neonates  
-child less than one year old  
-child between 1 and five years old  
-adults  

146 proteins were identified and quantified.
